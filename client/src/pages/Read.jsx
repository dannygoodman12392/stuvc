// The Read — two columns that never merge.
//
// Danny: "This should run a comprehensive diligence check on the company
// (product, team, market, etc). It should cover all the bases to equip me to
// write a full-fledged memo on the company. In fact, it should be pretty close to
// a memo. And I should be able to add my own thoughts."
//
// And from his own analysis, the thing this page exists to fix:
//   "I don't bring anything to IC. It's really annoying... I should be the deal
//    leader. So I need the info to be able to take on that role."
//
// ── WHAT I DID NOT REBUILD ──
// The engine. conviction.js is 563 lines where every refusal is load-bearing and
// every comment records a real bug found empirically. The agents, the rubric-first
// ordering, temperature 0, the 8192 token ceiling, the retry wrapper — all of it
// stays. The nightly workup task also out-researches Stu (web access, cited URLs,
// a 4-lens panel) and this does not compete with it.
//
// What was missing was never the analysis. It was a PLACE FOR DANNY. The old page
// was 1,541 lines with literally zero <input> or <textarea> — and a section that
// rendered, on every assessment, forever:
//
//     Personal conviction
//     Unanswered
//     Your call. Stu does not assess this.
//
// An honest placeholder for the exact hole he keeps asking me to fill.
//
// ── BLIND-FIRST, AND WHY IT'S NOT A GIMMICK ──
// His call is entered BEFORE Stu's read unlocks. If he reads a 7.8 and then types
// his view, that isn't calibration — it's priming, and the disagreement record it
// produces is worthless because it can only ever measure how much he anchors.
//
// Portfolio Pattern Analysis names the blind spot this serves: "you pass well on
// markets, poorly on documentation — and the gap is exactly on your best founders
// ... you can't tell whether those were good passes or fear/laziness." The only
// cure is a dated view recorded BEFORE the outcome is known. That's this screen.
//
// The gap between his band and Stu's is the artifact. It's the only dataset here
// that compounds, and the only question no tool he can buy can answer — because
// answering it requires a record of what he thought before he knew.

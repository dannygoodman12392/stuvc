// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// The board. Move companies you already know through your deal stages.
//
// Rewritten onto the design system. What it replaced had colored columns (blue,
// yellow), avatar circles, colored badges, and cards so tall only three fit on a
// screen — and it led with the PERSON's name on a board of COMPANIES.
//
// Three rules it now obeys:
//   · Color means state, never decoration. The columns are hairlines and ground.
//     A stage is a POSITION, and position is already the signal; painting it too
//     says the same thing twice in a louder voice.
//   · One primary ink per card — the company. The founder recedes.
//   · A stage badge on a card sitting in that stage's column is one bit of
//     information printed twice. Gone.
//
// ── THE (NO STAGE) COLUMN IS NOT A STYLE CHOICE ──
// The old board did `f[stageField] || stages[0]` and silently dumped every
// stage-less company into the first column — which is how a column read 71 when
// only 40 companies actually carried that status. That is the same failure as a
// going-cold clock computed off an import date: an absence rendered as a definite
// state. It kept its own column, and that column said what it was.
//
// It is now almost always empty, and deliberately so: the server only sends cards
// that HAVE a stage (routes/pipeline.js), because a card with no stage is not an
// opportunity — it's untriaged sourcing output, and it belongs in Sourcing. The
// column stays for the case the server is wrong. An empty lane costs one hairline.
//
// ── ONE BOARD, ONE AXIS, AND A BADGE ──
// Danny: "Let's merge Investment and Admissions pipelines, consolidating.
// Investment and/or Admissions Pipeline should be a badge I can edit on each card,
// similar to what I have in Airtable."
//
// So `stage_status` is the only axis, spelled in Airtable's words, and the
// Resident/Investment track moved from being a whole separate BOARD to a chip on
// the card. This mirrors how Airtable models it — one Admission Status field, one
// Pipeline multi-select — which is the point: the tool should read like the base
// he actually maintains.

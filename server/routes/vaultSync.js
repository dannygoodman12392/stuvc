/**
 * routes/vaultSync.js — a narrow, single-purpose read channel for the local Obsidian
 * vault-sync automation. Deliberately NOT part of the shareable MCP token system: Stu's
 * MCP surface has an explicit design boundary ("no code path to founders / assessments /
 * notes / memos — those stay private to Stu's owner") because Stu is shared with portfolio
 * founders and VC friends who mint their own MCP tokens. This endpoint exists so Danny's
 * OWN local automation can read his OWN assessments to write them into his vault, without
 * ever touching that shared surface — gated by a single fixed secret only he holds
 * (VAULT_SYNC_SECRET), never exposed in any UI, never distributable via the token flow.
 *
 * Fails closed: if VAULT_SYNC_SECRET isn't set, every request 503s — no accidental exposure.
 * Owner-only (userId 1), matching the existing convention for other owner-only automation
 * (e.g. the weekly founder digest).

//
// ── WHY NORMALISED, AND WHY THAT ISN'T A LOOSENING ──
// Exact match was losing real calls to cosmetic drift, measured against the live
// board and 90 days of Granola titles:
//
//   Granola "Uptake AI"  vs card "Uptake AI"       -> fine
//   Granola "Onnyx"      vs card "ONNYX Systesm"   -> MISSED (typo in the card)
//   Granola "Kelvin"     vs card "Kelvon"          -> MISSED (typo somewhere)
//
// So we normalise. But normalising ALONE is how "Peak" starts matching "Peak Labs",
// which is the exact failure resolve-company-linkedin.js and lib/edgar.js are both
// built to refuse. The safety doesn't come from strictness — it comes from
// REFUSING AMBIGUITY. Every query below returns ALL matches, and more than one
// match is a refusal, not a coin flip.

// Danny: "Agents should comb through my sourcing, pipeline, and the rest of the
// product and offer relevant priority tasks. And I need to be able to
// add/modify/delete them, including any that I create."
//
// The nightly workup is the only agent with real input — it reads every Granola
// call. So it writes tasks here, and Danny owns them the moment they land.
//
// ── THE THREE RULES THAT KEEP THIS FROM BECOMING NOISE ──
//
// 1. EVERY TASK CARRIES ITS QUOTE. `quote` is required. "Send the deck" is a nag
//    that costs nothing to ignore and reappears tomorrow looking identical.
//    "My next step, I guess, is I'll send you some slides" — Dan Preiss, July 14
//    — is a fact he can act on without re-deriving anything. The quote is the
//    difference between a task and a chore, and it's why the agent must have READ
//    something to be allowed to write here.
//
// 2. DEDUPE_KEY IS MANDATORY. The task re-reads the same week every night, so the
//    same suggestion arrives ~7 times. Without idempotency the list fills with
//    duplicates and he stops opening it by Thursday. Same reason the commitment
//    ledger has one.
//
// 3. A DISMISSED TASK STAYS DEAD. today_items.dismissed_at is a tombstone and
//    DELETE tombstones agent rows rather than removing them (routes/today.js:154).
//    So a re-run CANNOT resurrect something he threw away — the single most common
//    way this pattern dies. This endpoint checks the tombstone before inserting.
//
// What this endpoint deliberately does NOT do: send anything, write to Airtable,
// or email a founder. Danny's hard constraint — "Just nudge me to follow up."

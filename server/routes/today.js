// Today — the surface.
//
// Stu is not a second brain. Obsidian is the brain, the nightly tasks are the
// analyst, Airtable is the team's window. Stu is the SCREEN you open at 9am and
// work from all day — the one thing none of the others can be, because they hold
// documents and this holds state that changes.
//
// Two rules that come straight from Danny:
//
//   1. "It is my to-do list — I should be able to add/modify/delete/check-off my
//      own ideas in addition to what your agents suggest."
//      → Agents are GUESTS here. His rows are his. Agent rows tombstone rather
//        than delete, so a re-run can never resurrect something he dismissed.
//
//   2. "I want to inflate my pipeline numbers."
//      → So the headline number is DECIDED, not pipeline. A metric he has told me
//        he games is a metric I will not build.
//
// And the lanes are not chores — they're DECISIONS. Danny: "Sometimes I just don't
// feel like following up... Or I'm waiting to think through if I believe in a
// company or not." The follow-up isn't blocked by discipline, it's blocked by an
// unformed view. So the first lane is UNDECIDED, and nagging comes second.

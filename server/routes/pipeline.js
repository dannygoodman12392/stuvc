//
// Danny, verbatim and repeatedly: "I want to transition Stu into being my
// personal Affinity/Harmonic (sourcing, tracking, assessing). And then I publish
// memos in Obsidian for opportunities that warrant it."
//
// That is ONE sentence about ONE object. Stu had four screens pretending it had
// four objects: a sourced founder, a founder, and an assessment were three
// tables that didn't know about each other, so approving someone from Discover
// turned them into a different record and nothing carried forward.
//
// ── WHY THERE IS NO `companies` TABLE ──
// The obvious fix is a companies/people migration. It was priced at 10-15 days
// and it is a trap wearing a feature's clothes. It is also unnecessary:
// `founders` is already the spine, and every other table already points at it.
// One record means every stage JOINS to founders — which is what this file does.
// Measured before deciding (2026-07-15): 187 live founders, 5,328 soft-deleted.
// The scary "5,513 rows / 1,841 fuzzy company strings" the rebuild brief priced
// the migration against is 96% deleted junk. There is no dedupe project here.
// Do not start one.
//
// ── THE COLUMNS, AND WHY THESE ONES ──
// Company · Stage · Source · Read (Stu) · Call (Danny) · Owed · Signal
//
// READ and CALL are two columns that never merge. Stu's band and Danny's band
// sit side by side, and the DISAGREEMENT is the artifact — it's the only dataset
// in this product that compounds, and the only question no tool he can buy is
// able to answer, because answering it needs a record of what he thought before
// he knew.
//
// ── COLUMNS DELIBERATELY ABSENT ──
// "Who knows them" is Affinity's whole $2,000/user/year product and it needs a
// relationship graph that does not exist in this database yet. "Last contact" is
// worse than absent — it's fake: every live founder's updated_at is 2026-03-18,
// the Airtable import. Shipping either as an empty or lying column would teach
// Danny to distrust the row. They arrive when their data does.

// card, similar to what I have in Airtable."
//
// So there is ONE board with ONE stage axis in Airtable's words, and the
// Resident/Investment track is a badge. Exactly two things move: the stage (drag)
// and the badge (click).
//
// THE STAGE PUBLISHES. THE BADGE DOES NOT. Danny drew that line himself:
//
//   "I'm comfortable with you publishing stage updates to Airtable. But that's it.
//    I'm going to primarily work in Stu, and then choose to enter my own context to
//    the team view in Airtable depending on what I want them to see."
//
// Stu is where he works; Airtable is what the team sees; he decides what crosses.
// The stage crosses because the team's view of where a deal stands must not
// silently disagree with his, and because the 5:45am sync would otherwise revert
// his drag by morning. The badge stays home.
//
// The stage drag is the ONLY caller in this file that passes { explicit: true }.
// Every scheduled job is still refused by the gate in services/airtable-sync.js.
// A human pressing a card is not an agent; that distinction is the whole rule.
//

// report a move that Airtable rejected — which is this codebase's oldest bug, a
// status message decoupled from the thing it describes. If Airtable refuses, the
// response says so and names the reason.

// POST /api/pipeline — a new card, from the board.
//
// Danny: "these founder/company kanban cards in Pipeline need to be highly
// editable, I need to be able to create and delete the cards themselves."
//
// POST /api/founders has existed the whole time, and /founders/new is a routed
// page. Neither is reachable from Pipeline, which is where he actually lives — so
// the capability may as well not have existed. This is the same write, at the
// place the work happens.
//
// ── WHY BOTH NAMES ARE REQUIRED ──
// `founders` is the spine, and a row on it is A PERSON. The March Airtable import
// wrote COMPANY records into it with the company in the name column, which is why
// isPerson() exists forty lines up and why the board still has rows called
// "Gatsby Robotics" where a human should be. A composer that accepts a bare company
// name would manufacture that exact junk at speed. Two fields, both required.
//
// ── WHY THIS DOES NOT TOUCH AIRTABLE ──
// The board's rule, and Danny's: the STAGE publishes, nothing else does. Airtable is
// team-visible and this is his private workbench, so a card he makes here is his
// until he drags it. Verified the nightly sync can't punish that — neither
// airtable-sync.js nor airtable-import.js soft-deletes rows it doesn't recognise,
// and the import matches on name, so a founder he later adds to the team's base
// links up to this card rather than duplicating it.

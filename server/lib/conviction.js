//
// Canonical rubric: Brain/02 Frameworks/Founder Rubric.md
// Core question: "When it goes sideways — not IF, but WHEN — will this founder
// see it early, adapt, and still win?"
//
// Two rules, both load-bearing:
//
//   1. Code does arithmetic. The LLM does judgment. (Stu's existing discipline —
//      see correctPillarScores. Kept.)
//
//   2. A conviction score is NEVER reported above the confidence its evidence
//      supports. This is the rule Stu was missing. It previously scored 2KB of
//      marketing copy with exactly the same authority as a deck plus two
//      transcripts — same word, same colour, same three-decimal arithmetic. A
//      URL-only run reliably produced "Pass ≈ 4.3", indistinguishable from a
//      Pass earned by reading everything and finding real problems.
//
// Rule 2 is why computeEvidenceRung is here and not in a prompt. Evidence
// strength is a fact about which inputs exist. The model never gets a vote on
// how much to trust itself.

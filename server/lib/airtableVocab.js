//
// Danny maintains the funnel by hand in the team's Airtable base and asked for
// Stu's board to read exactly like it: "Investment and/or Admissions Pipeline
// should be a badge I can edit on each card, similar to what I have in Airtable.
// Use Airtable right now as the source of truth for the correct stage."
//
// So there is no translation layer here, on purpose. Stu used to keep a parallel
// vocabulary ('Sourced', 'Outreach', 'First Call Scheduled') and map onto these
// strings — and that mapping is what silently destroyed four months of his stage
// changes and put 22 declined founders back on the live board as prospects.
// A second vocabulary is a second thing to drift. These strings are Airtable's.
//
// Pulled from the live base schema 2026-07-16 (base appfE9DVrSUOrkkpu,
// table tblWkJzy5qpw7FP2M). If Danny adds a select option in Airtable, it must be
// added here too — test/airtable-vocab.test.js fails loudly when they diverge, so
// this cannot rot quietly.

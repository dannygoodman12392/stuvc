// founderFit — the founder-quality check Danny asked for, in his own terms.
//
// "I want a founder quality check you can run against candidates to identify,
// select, and prioritize who I should meet. I want to meet pre-seed/stealth/early
// builders who have Chicago/Illinois ties AND: hyperscale experience, or previous
// founding experience, or exited a startup in a good way (which is better to me
// than previous founding experience), they got into or have been in YC, they are
// members of South Park Commons, they got into or have been in a16z speedrun or
// Z Fellows, they have raised venture capital previously, or they went to a
// prestigious Chicago/IL school and have a track record that lends itself to
// building outliers."
//
// The rubric is two GATES and one SCORE, and keeping them separate is the whole
// point — it's the distinction the old caliber scorer collapsed.
//
//   GATE 1 — STAGE (of the CURRENT company). Must be earliest-stage: stealth,
//     pre-seed, just incorporated, building. A company that is clearly PAST that —
//     a Series A, a big priced round, real scale — fails, no matter how strong the
//     founder. This is the Matt Silver / Cargado fix: he's a strong founder, but
//     Cargado is not a company at the stage Danny wants to meet.
//
//   GATE 2 — ILLINOIS TIE. Handled upstream by lib/ilTie + the queue's TIE_CLAUSE;
//     this module trusts a verified tie and never invents one.
//
//   SCORE — the OUTLIER MARKERS, which describe the founder's BACKGROUND, not the
//     current company. "Raised VC previously" and "prior exit" are background wins;
//     they belong here, NOT in the stage gate. This separation is exactly why the
//     old scorer failed: it read "raised institutional capital" off the current
//     company and rewarded it, pulling in companies already underway.
//
// THE CARDINAL RULE, inherited from the honesty gate: a marker only counts if its
// evidence quote is verbatim in the profile text. detect() returns the substring
// that fired, and markersFor() drops any whose quote isn't actually present. The
// "Why they're here" line is built from what survives — which is the fix for
// "some of the descriptions are good, some are bad": a chip cannot appear without
// a receipt.

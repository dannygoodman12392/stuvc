// The commitment ledger — the one thing only Stu can hold.
//
// Danny's first-call script, Q10:
//   "The delta between what they said and what they did is my single best
//    signal — it's the one thing they can't perform."
//
// He has never recorded it. Not once. Grep the vault: "Q10" appears in exactly
// one file — the question bank itself. Concorda has THREE call notes; the only
// use of "commitment" in call two is "$3M round with full commitments secured",
// a fundraising fact. No call two has ever opened with call one's promise.
//
// Why this lives in Stu and not in the vault or a scheduled task:
//   The vault holds DOCUMENTS. The workup task writes an excellent one every
//   night. But a commitment is not a document — it's STATE. It has a clock, it
//   changes, it comes due, it gets kept or broken. A markdown file can record
//   that a promise was made; only a database can tell you it's three days late.
//   That is the entire reason Stu exists as a surface over the tasks.
//
// And it's how movement 2 gets earned. A founder SAYING they update is
// self-report. Watching what they did against what they said is an observation.
// Execution & Learning Velocity is one of the two STRONG-evidence movements and
// it cannot honestly be scored off one call. It can be scored off the delta.

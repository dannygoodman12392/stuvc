// The attention engine — what needs Danny today, computed from pipeline state.
//
// PROVENANCE: these rules are Danny's, not mine. On 2026-07-07 he wrote a spec
// into Permute for a "Venture Pipeline Daily Operating Dashboard" and led with:
//
//   "1. Needs My Attention Today (top of page, most important)
//      - Superior Portfolio rows where Next Follow Up Date is today or past
//      - Founder Ecosystem rows where Steward-Operator Flagged is checked and
//        Admission Status is not yet finalized
//      - Founder Ecosystem rows where 'Add to Investment Pipeline' is checked
//        but the company does not appear in Investment Pipeline
//        (A PROMOTION THAT FELL THROUGH THE CRACKS)
//      - Investment Pipeline rows where 'Add to Portfolio' is checked but the
//        company does not appear in Superior Portfolio (same check, one stage
//        later)"
//
// Three of his four rules are CROSS-STAGE INTEGRITY CHECKS. Not "nag me to
// follow up" — find the things that fell BETWEEN the stages. That is the right
// model for two reasons he has stated himself:
//
//   "A lot of it is neglect."          → the failure is dropped things, not laziness
//   "I want to inflate my pipeline numbers."
//                                      → so no rule may ever COUNT the pipeline.
//                                        Every rule below counts a GAP, and a gap
//                                        is a number he has no incentive to game:
//                                        the only way to make it go down is to
//                                        actually do the thing.
//
// And a gap check only works if the stages are one connected record, which is
// why this file is the thing that proves the substrate.
//
// ── THE RULE THAT MAKES THIS RENDER HONESTLY ──
// Every check returns a row EVERY DAY, including when it is clean. Permute does
// this and it is the reason their screen is trustworthy: "✓ Portfolio Follow-Ups
// Overdue — No overdue follow-ups" sits right next to the amber one. A list that
// only appears when there's a problem is indistinguishable from a list that is
// broken. Silence has to mean "I looked," not "I didn't run."
//
// ── WHAT THIS IS NOT ──
// Not a nag. Danny: "Sometimes I just don't feel like following up... Or I'm
// waiting to think through if I believe in a company or not." The blocker isn't
// discipline, it's an unformed view — so a rule fires on the DECISION being
// absent, and the affordance is always "form the view," never "send the email."
// Per his hard constraint, no rule here may ever send anything.

// company renders "Prizm — Prizm (Company)".

//
// Measured 2026-07-15 on the live DB: EVERY one of the 187 live founders has
// updated_at = 2026-03-18, and all 189 founder_notes fall inside 2026-03-16..18.
// That is the one-time Airtable import, not contact. call_logs has zero rows.
//
// So a going-cold check would have told Danny "118 days quiet" about all 40 live
// deals, every day, forever — a number computed off the day the data was loaded.
// That is precisely the failure the conviction engine one layer down exists to
// prevent: rendering an infrastructure gap and a real judgment identically. The
// engine's rule is "below the evidence rung there is no score, there's a question
// list," and the attention layer has to obey the same rule or it inherits the
// dishonesty the rebuild was meant to remove.
//
// So the check BLOCKS itself rather than firing. This is self-diagnosing, not a
// hardcoded off-switch: the moment a real touch lands — Granola workups pushing
// to the write path that already carries commitments — freshness returns and the
// check starts running on its own. Nobody has to remember to turn it back on.

/**
 * Airtable → Stu sync
 *
 * Airtable's "Superior Founder Ecosystem" is the team's CRM and the source of
 * truth for where a founder stands. Danny maintains it by hand. This pulls it in.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY THIS FILE WAS REWRITTEN (2026-07-16)
 *
 * The header used to say, proudly: "Existing founders are NOT overwritten.
 * Safe to run repeatedly — only inserts new records."
 *
 * It ran every morning at 5:45. It fetched all 162 records, and for every
 * founder already in Stu it hit `skipped++; continue;`. So the ONLY Airtable
 * edit that could ever reach Stu was the creation of a brand new founder.
 * Every stage change Danny made by hand for four months was fetched, compared,
 * and thrown away — daily — while the log printed a reassuring
 * "Done: 0 imported, 162 skipped (already exist)".
 *
 * This is the same bug this codebase keeps producing: a status message decoupled
 * from the thing it describes. "Skipped" was doing the work of "discarded".
 *
 * Measured the morning it was found: 49 of 159 matched founders (31%) disagreed
 * with what a fresh sync of that day's Airtable would say. The failures ran in
 * the worst possible direction:
 *   · 22 founders Danny had already declined (Stage 5: Not Admitted / Pass on
 *     Investment) sat on Stu's board as LIVE prospects — "First Call Scheduled".
 *   · 4 admitted residents (Stage 4) showed as unclosed prospects.
 *   · 8 company names were wrong, incl. Vishnu Indukuri's, which Stu called
 *     "Stealth" while Airtable had said "Brae Systems" for months.
 *
 * A pipeline tool whose board shows dead deals as live meetings is worse than no
 * pipeline tool. So: this now UPDATES.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * FIELD OWNERSHIP — the only interesting decision here
 *
 * AUTHORITATIVE (Airtable always wins, every run, and the change is logged):
 *   the funnel facts Danny curates in Airtable and nowhere else — admission
 *   status, next step, company name, one-liner, HQ, current stage, previous
 *   companies. A BLANK Airtable cell is never authoritative: it means "unset",
 *   not "delete what Stu knows".
 *
 * FILL-IF-EMPTY (Airtable may fill a blank, never clobber a value):
 *   email, linkedin_url, website_url, next_action, source. Stu is where Danny
 *   types, and `next_action` in particular carries context from his own pipeline
 *   dumps that has no Airtable equivalent. Overwriting it would delete his work.
 *   `source` is here because Stu's and Airtable's are false friends — Stu's says
 *   WHO ("Danny Goodman"), Airtable's says the CHANNEL ("Outbound").
 *
 * UNIONED: pipeline_tracks. Airtable can add a founder to a board; only Danny
 *   takes one off. See mergeTracks().
 *
 * NEVER TOUCHED: conviction scores, assessments, sources, signals, notes,
 *   deal_status, and `name` (the match key). Those are Stu's. Airtable has no
 *   opinion about them. Enforced by test/mirror-integrity.test.js.
 *
 * This is a ONE-WAY read. It does not write to Airtable — see airtable-sync.js,
 * whose gate requires an explicit publish-to-team action. Airtable is shared with
 * the team; nothing automatic goes back up it.

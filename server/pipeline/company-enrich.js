// Danny, 2026-07-15: "I want the same level of insight (for example, company
// pages on LinkedIn show how many people work there and have been hired at these
// companies over time). You can see where the founders previously worked, etc.
// I'll pay for enrichment."
//
// Only PERSON enrichment was wired (linkedin-enrich.js -> /api/v2/profile).
// Company-level data — headcount, growth, funding — was nowhere in the codebase.
//
// ── THE CONTRACT, verified against EnrichLayer's live docs 2026-07-15 ──
// Not assumed. The USPTO connector in this same repo calls an endpoint that has
// never existed and returns 0 forever because nobody checked, and the Form D
// connector shipped `locationCode` (singular) which EDGAR silently ignores —
// returning identical nationwide results for every state. Two bugs, one cause:
// an endpoint written from memory. So every path and parameter below is quoted
// from the docs.
//
//   GET /api/v2/company
//     url* , funding_data=include (+1cr), exit_data, acquisitions, extra, use_cache
//     -> company_size [min,max], company_size_on_linkedin, founded_year,
//        industry, hq{}, funding_data
//
//   GET /api/v2/company/employees/count
//     url* , at_date=YYYY-MM-DD (+1cr Growth tier / +5cr otherwise),
//     employment_status=current|past|all, estimated_employee_count=include (+1cr)
//     -> { estimated_employee_count, verified_employee_count }
//
// Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <key>` on both. Base cost 1 credit each.
//
// ── HEADCOUNT OVER TIME IS N CALLS, NOT ONE ──
// The endpoint returns a SNAPSHOT. `at_date` time-travels to one date. So a
// growth curve is one call per point, and the cost is linear in resolution. We
// take 4 points over 12 months (now, -3, -6, -12) — enough to see a slope, cheap
// enough to run across the whole pipeline. Danny's read is "are they hiring?",
// which needs a direction, not a daily series.

// THE ROSTER — one call that replaces the whole at_date approach.
//
// Danny, on LinkedIn Premium's "400% employee growth" card: "They have employee
// growth data in LinkedIn. I think you can learn these insights cheaply."
//
// He was right, and I'd built it the expensive way. `at_date` buys ONE crude
// snapshot per credit and can never say who those people are. The employee
// listing costs 3cr/employee (+1 to enrich) and returns every employee's
// START DATE — from which the EXACT headcount at any date is arithmetic, free,
// forever. For a 2-10 person company (Danny's entire book) that's ~12-40 credits
// for strictly more than at_date could ever give:
//
//   · the exact curve, not 4 sampled points
//   · WHO each person is, and when they joined
//   · WHERE THEY WORKED BEFORE  <- Danny's explicit ask; at_date cannot answer it
//   · recent hires, which is LinkedIn's own card
//
// Verified live on Permute AI (2026-07-15), 3 employees, one call:
//   Scott Nelson   CEO,  joined 2025-07, prev: Density Collective, Scout Space
//   Eric Mills     CTO,  joined 2025-08, prev: Density Collective, BlackInk AI
//   Parsia Hedayat AI,   joined 2026-03, prev: Integral Ad Science
//
// Cost notes from the docs, which shape every default below:
//   sort_by (non-"none") is +50 base +10/employee — ruinous, and pointless when
//   we hold every start date and can sort in memory for free. Never send it.
//   page_size is capped at 10 when enriching, so >10 employees needs paging.
